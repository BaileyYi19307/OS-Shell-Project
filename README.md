# OS-Shell-Project
This project is a custom shell developed as part of my Operating Systems class. It simulates the basic functionalities of a Unix-like shell, supporting command execution, pipes, input/output redirection, and background processes. The shell also includes built-in commands like cd, exit, and help.
